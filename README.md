## Problem Statement

Find the **highest salary** that was credited to an employee, **excluding transactions made on the 1st day of any month**. Along with the salary, extract the following details of the employee who received it:

- **Name**: Combine `FIRST_NAME` and `LAST_NAME` into a single column `NAME`.
- **Age**: Calculate the age of the employee.
- **Department**: The department name of the employee.

### Output Format

The result should contain these columns:

| Column Name        | Description                                                  |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| SALARY             | The highest salary credited (not on the 1st of the month)    |
| NAME               | Employee's full name (`FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME`)               |
| AGE                | Employee's age                                              |
| DEPARTMENT_NAME    | Name of the department                                       |

## SQL Solution

Hereâ€™s the SQL query written to solve the problem:

```sql
SELECT 
    p.AMOUNT AS SALARY,
    CONCAT(e.FIRST_NAME, ' ', e.LAST_NAME) AS NAME,
    FLOOR(DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), e.DOB)/365) AS AGE,
    d.DEPARTMENT_NAME
FROM PAYMENTS p
JOIN EMPLOYEE e ON p.EMP_ID = e.EMP_ID
JOIN DEPARTMENT d ON e.DEPARTMENT = d.DEPARTMENT_ID
WHERE DAY(p.PAYMENT_TIME) != 1
ORDER BY p.AMOUNT DESC
LIMIT 1;
